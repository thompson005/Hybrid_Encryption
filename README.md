# Hybrid_Encryption
This project implements a hybrid authentication system in Python, combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods for enhanced security. User passwords are securely encrypted using symmetric encryption, and the symmetric key is stored securely using asymmetric encryption. The cryptography library is utilized for encryption .
